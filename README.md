<h1>Benign</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
We will investigate host-centric logs in this challenge room to find suspicious process execution.

<b>One of the clientâ€™s IDS indicated a potentially suspicious process execution indicating one of the hosts from the HR department was compromised. Some tools related to network information gathering / scheduled tasks were executed which confirmed the suspicion. Due to limited resources, we could only pull the process execution logs with Event ID: 4688 and ingested them into Splunk with the index win_eventlogs for further investigation.

About the Network Information

The network is divided into three logical segments. It will help in the investigation.

<b>Answer the question below <br/>

How many logs are ingested from the month of March, 2022?

<p align="center">
  First, I input into the search bar index=win-eventlogs since that is where all the information is stored and I also added EventID=4688 for the type of event discovered. Seecond, I adjusted the date range since it is asking about the month of March in the year 2022. After those two steps, I received the answer.

Imposter Alert: There seems to be an imposter account observed in the logs, what is the name of that user?

<p align="center">
    I had to do a google search on how to write the proper query for creating a list of users. I was about to find it in the splunk community website. I pressed enter of the completed search query(#1) and saw two users that appeared very similar. With a closer look, I spotted the imposter(#2).

<b>Answer the question below <br/>
Which user from the HR department was observed to be running scheduled tasks?


<p align="center">
    I didn't know how to find ran scheduled tasks on Splunk so I began to type scheduled task on the search bar and 'schtasks' appeared, I pressed enter and got results. The full search query was 'index=win-eventlogs schtasks'. I then clicked on the field UserName and saw several values. I looked at each user and only one of them where from the HR department.

<b>Answer the question below <br/>
Which user from the HR department executed a system process (LOLBIN) to download a payload from a file-sharing host.

<p align="center">
    I decided to filter for only the HR employees. Because there were so many commands, I decided to add the filter ' | stats count by CommandLine ' to make it easier to analyze. I looked at all the results that were executables and the only one that stood out to me was the first result that appeared.

  There was a hint to this question and it read 'Explore lolbas-project.github.io/ to find binaries used to download payloads'. After doing researh on what a LOLBIN is, I googled 'lolbin certutil.exe' and read that attackers would use certutil.exe for exploitation. So now that I know I have the right command, I clicked and added the command into the search query. I looked for the field username and found the answer.

    To be honest, I did not know what I was looking for. The hint I received for this question was 'Try looking in the IIS logs for POST requests.' I did not know what IIS logs are but I have an idea of what POST requests are. So in the Splunk search bar I added POST and pressed enter. I started searching through the interested fields looking for 'IIS'. In the field sourcetype, it had 'iis' as a value so I added that into the search bar as well.

    I don't know what a web shell exploit looks like so I googled 'web shell file type exploit'. While do some reading, I came across several and inputting them into the search bar in Splunk with the wildcard(*) attached hoping for a bite. The only one that produced results was 'asp'.
